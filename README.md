# Heart-issue-Detection-system
Jupyter Notebook project that predicts heart disease using logistic regression on clinical data. Built with scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy.

# Heart Disease Detection System

This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient based on various clinical parameters such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc. It is built entirely in a Jupyter Notebook and uses logistic regression for classification.

## Features

- Trained on heart disease data
- Preprocessing included
- Predicts presence or absence of heart disease
- Simple, interpretable logistic regression model

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
3. Run the cells step-by-step
4. Make predictions by modifying the input data
